### New website

Gatsby, SSR, TypeScript, Netfliy

### Test with gatsby

#### Good thing

1. Route already configured. User can focus on the content instead of configuration.
2. It takes general ideas of modern web development, there are many good practices to learn.

#### Bad thing

Lots of things are hidden. Web development is not that easy in real case without Gastby.

#### Todo

- eco system, plugin
- blog made with markdown
- ssr
