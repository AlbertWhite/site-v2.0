### New website

Gatsby, SSR, TypeScript, Netfliy

### Test with gatsby

#### Good thing

1. Route already configured. User can focus on the content instead of configuration.
2. The idea of using general stylesheet and css module, css in JS is good, as well as the idea of layout component, page component and shared component.
3. It takes general ideas of modern web development, there are many good practices to learn.
4. Plugins. [Plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)
5. Data: “everything that lives outside a React component”.
6. Query: only pages can make page queries. Non-page components, such as Layout, can use StaticQuery. [With node createPage API instead of graphQL query](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-without-graphql/)

#### Bad thing

Lots of things are hidden. Web development is not that easy in real case without Gastby.

#### Todo

- eco system, plugin
- blog made with markdown
- ssr
