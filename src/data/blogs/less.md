I have been working on front-end development for more than 4 years, and I keep learning technical things (you can check my blogs as evidence), however, I found that it is not suffisant for my current role.

I am working in [Thefork](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-fork-a-tripadvisor-company/mycompany/), it is a very good company, and I am working with senior front-end developers. The more I worked with them, the more difference I found between us.

We are both good at implementation in detail, and they are better than me in designing the solution and viewing the problems at a high level. They are able to compare different implementation methods, view pros and cons and choose the best solution.

For years I have been writing articles about best practices for a certain framework. But being a better developer, being a senior developer is more than that, they should know the tools, but **they should also be able to select the best tool for the right problem.** For example, knowing how to do basic carpenter work doesn't mean that you can build a stable and big wooden house. **Knowing how to do is only the first step**.

That's why I wrote less technical articles, because I have a better knowledge base now, and there are tons of good tutorials on the internet, but none of the articles mentions how to solve the real in-hand problems (performance dropÂ ? seo implementation ?) You need to work on it, analyse situations, launch communications, and solve problems.

There are tons of articles about how to live a good life, but only reading those articles doesn't guarantee that you will live a good life. Live a good life needs you to live in reality and solve problems.

That's my shift from junior to senior: from learning to designing and doing.

Good luck for the year 2022.
